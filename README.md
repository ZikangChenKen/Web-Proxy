# Web-Proxy
A concurrent web proxy that logs requests. 

A web proxy is a program that acts as a middleman between a web browser and an end server. Instead of contacting the end server directly to get a web page, the browser contacts the proxy, which forwards the request on to the end server. When the end server replies to the proxy, the proxy sends the reply on to the browser.
